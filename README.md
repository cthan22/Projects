**a2.py** is a dashboard to monitor and analyze historical and trending sunspot activity. The data for this dashboard comes from the Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO), an activity of the Solar Influences Data analysis Center (SIDC) provided by the Royal Observatory of Belgium. Specifically, the dataset used contained the monthly mean total sunspot number going back to the year 1749 up to 2023. Extended Abstract.pdf provides further detail. 

**sankeyA1.py**, **sankey_wrapper.py**, and **Assignment1.py** make up a multilevel Sankey diagram framework. The particular diagram in the example groups a dataset of artists by gender, nationality, and time period. 

**Frenzy.java** is a one-player game based on the popular game "Feeding Frenzy". The user plays as a fish and the goal is to eat smaller fish while avoidng being eaten by larger fish. To win, you must eat enough fish to become the largest in the game.

**FifteenWorld.java** is a one-player game based on the game "15 Puzzle". The user plays on a 4x4 grid of numbered tiles and can move one tile at a time until they are able to line up the numbers from 1 to 15 in order.

**BridgIt.java** is a two-player game based on the game "BridgIt". The players, each assigned a different color, take turns filling in the blank spaces in order to make a path from one end of the board to the other. The player who completes their path first wins.
