Frenzy.java is a one-player game based on the popular game "Feeding Frenzy". The user plays as a fish and the goal is to eat smaller fish while avoidng being eaten by larger fish. To win, you must eat enough fish to become the largest in the game.

FifteenWorld.java is a one-player game based on the game "15 Puzzle". The user plays on a 4x4 grid of numbered tiles and can move one tile at a time until they are able to line up the numbers from 1 to 15 in order.

BridgIt.java is a two-player game based on the game "BridgIt". The players, each assigned a different color, take turns filling in the blank spaces in order to make a path from one end of the board to the other. The player who completes their path first wins.
